        "content": "Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\nWe have a string s (with n letters) and we need to repeatedly remove the first vowel that has a vowel immediately before it (so two consecutive vowels) until there are no two consecutive vowels.\n\nThe vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y'.\n\nThe example: \n  Input: \"aaeaa\" becomes \"a\"\n\nHow does that work?\n  Step 1: \"aaeaa\" -> remove the first vowel that has a vowel before it. \n          The first two are 'a' and 'a' (consecutive vowels). So we remove the first 'a'? \n          But note: the rule says: \"deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\".\n\nWait, the problem says: \"as long as there are two consecutive vowels in the word, it deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\".\n\nLet me re-read: \"deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\". \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let me look at the example: aaeaa -> becomes a.\n\nThe example says: \n  aaeaa \u2192 aeaa \u2192 aaa \u2192 aa \u2192 a\n\nSo step by step:\n  Start: a a e a a\n  Step1: remove the first vowel that has a vowel before it? \n          Actually, the rule says: \"deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\". \n\nBut note: the example says: \"aeaa\" is the next step. How?\n\nIn \"aaeaa\", the first two letters are 'a' and 'a' (consecutive vowels). The rule says: we delete the first vowel that has a vowel right before it. \n\nBut which one? The rule says: \"the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\". \n\nSo we look for the first occurrence of a vowel that has a vowel immediately preceding it. Then we remove that vowel? Or remove the one that is the second vowel?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\". \n\nLet me parse: \n  We have two consecutive vowels: [vowel1, vowel2]. \n  The rule says: we delete the first vowel that has a vowel right before it? \n\nActually, the problem states: \"it deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\". \n\nThis means: we are looking for a vowel that has a vowel right before it (so it's the second vowel in a consecutive pair). Then we remove that vowel? \n\nBut the example: \n  \"aaeaa\" -> \n      Step 1: the first consecutive pair is the first two 'a's. \n      We want to remove the vowel that has a vowel right before it. That would be the second 'a'? \n      Then we get: a e a a -> \"aeaa\"\n\nThen next step: \n      \"aeaa\": the consecutive vowels? \n        a and e -> both vowels? (yes, e is vowel) -> so we have \"ae\" -> consecutive vowels? \n        But note: the problem says \"two consecutive vowels\". So in \"ae\", 'a' and 'e' are consecutive vowels? \n        Then we remove the second vowel? -> so remove 'e'? \n        Then we get: a a a -> \"aaa\"\n\nThen next: \"aaa\" -> remove the second 'a'? -> \"aa\"\nThen next: \"aa\" -> remove the second 'a'? -> \"a\"\n\nSo the process: \n  We repeatedly scan from left to right, and as soon as we find two consecutive vowels (vowel, vowel), we remove the second one? \n\nBut wait: the problem says: \"deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\". \n\nThe phrase \"the first vowel\" (meaning the first occurrence of such a vowel) that has a vowel right before it. \n\nIn the string, we traverse from left to right. The first time we see a vowel that has a vowel immediately before it (so at position i, s[i] is a vowel and s[i-1] is a vowel), then we remove s[i]? \n\nBut the example: \n  \"aaeaa\": \n      positions: 0: 'a', 1: 'a' -> at position 1, we have a vowel that has a vowel before it (at 0). So we remove the vowel at position 1? Then we get \"a\" + \"eaa\" -> \"aeaa\".\n\nSo the algorithm: \n  We traverse the string from left to right. \n  We can use a stack? \n\nAlternative approach: \n  We can simulate the process by building a new string. \n  We traverse the string and for each character:\n      - if the current character is a vowel and the last character we added is a vowel, then we skip the current character (because we are removing the current vowel that has a vowel before it? Actually, no: the problem says we remove the vowel that has a vowel right before it. So if we have two consecutive vowels, we remove the second one? Then the next step we don't have two consecutive?)\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"as long as there are two consecutive vowels\" -> so we have to do until there are none.\n\nHowever, the problem also says: \"deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\". \n\nThis implies: we are scanning from the beginning and the first time we find two consecutive vowels, we remove the second vowel? \n\nBut the example: \n  \"aaeaa\": \n      Step1: remove the second 'a' (at index1) -> becomes \"aeaa\"\n      Step2: now in \"aeaa\", the next two: 'a' and 'e' -> consecutive vowels? Yes. So we remove the 'e'? \n          But wait: the rule says: we remove the vowel that has a vowel right before it. In \"ae\", the 'e' has a vowel ('a') right before? So we remove 'e'? Then we get \"aaa\".\n\n      Then in \"aaa\": \n          The first two: 'a' and 'a' -> remove the second 'a' -> \"aa\"\n      Then in \"aa\": remove the second -> \"a\"\n\nSo the process: \n  We repeatedly remove the first occurrence of a vowel that is immediately after a vowel (so the second vowel in a consecutive pair).\n\nHow to do this efficiently? \n\nConstraints: n <= 100. So we can do a while loop until no consecutive vowels.\n\nSteps:\n  1. Read n (we might not need it because the next line is the string)\n  2. Read the string s.\n  3. While there exists two consecutive vowels in s:\n        Find the first index i (starting from 1) such that s[i] is a vowel and s[i-1] is a vowel.\n        Then remove the character at index i (so s = s[0:i] + s[i+1:])\n        (Note: we remove the second vowel in the consecutive pair)\n\n  4. Output s.\n\nBut note: after removal, the string changes and we might create a consecutive pair that starts earlier? \n  Example: \"aaa\": \n      Step1: remove index1 -> \"aa\"\n      Step2: remove index1 -> \"a\"\n\nSo we have to do until no consecutive vowels.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"as long as there are two consecutive vowels\", so we do until we have none.\n\nBut the problem says: \"it deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\". \n\nThis means: we are scanning from the beginning and the first time we see a vowel that has a vowel before it (so the pair at positions i-1 and i) then we remove the vowel at i.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\n  vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n\n  s = input().strip()   # but note: first input is n, then the string. However, the problem says: first line is n, second line is the string.\n\n  Steps:\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      s = input().strip()\n\n  Then:\n      while True:\n          found = False\n          i = 1\n          while i < len(s):\n              if s[i] in vowels and s[i-1] in vowels:\n                  # remove s[i]\n                  s = s[:i] + s[i+1:]\n                  found = True\n                  # after removal, we break and restart from the beginning? \n                  # Because the removal might cause a new consecutive pair at i-1? \n                  # Example: \"aaa\": \n                  #   first removal: at i=1 -> becomes \"aa\", then we have to check again from the start.\n                  break\n              i += 1\n          if not found:\n              break\n\n  Then print(s)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\". So we break after the first removal and restart the scan from the beginning.\n\nWhy restart from the beginning? \n  Example: \n      s = \"aaeaa\"\n      Step1: we remove the second 'a' -> \"aeaa\"\n      Then we start again from the beginning: \n          a and e -> both vowels? -> yes, so remove 'e' -> \"aaa\"\n      Then next: remove the second 'a' -> \"aa\"\n      Then next: remove the second 'a' -> \"a\"\n\nBut in the above code, after removal we break and restart the while loop from the beginning (i=1). So it's correct.\n\nHowever, worst-case: n=100, and the string is 100 vowels: \"a\"*100. \n  We remove one at a time, so 99 removals -> 99 iterations of the while loop. \n  Each iteration scans up to 100 characters. So worst-case 99*100 = 9900, which is acceptable.\n\nBut the problem says: n<=100, so it's acceptable.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nExample 1: \"weird\" -> n=5\n  w: not vowel -> skip\n  e: vowel -> then next is 'i' (vowel) -> so we have \"ei\" -> consecutive vowels? \n      Actually: \n          s = \"weird\"\n          indices: \n            0: 'w' -> not vowel\n            1: 'e' -> vowel\n            2: 'i' -> vowel -> so at index2, we have a vowel that has a vowel before it (at index1). \n          So we remove s[2] -> becomes \"werd\"\n\n  Output: \"werd\" -> matches.\n\nExample 2: \"word\" -> no consecutive vowels? \n  w: not vowel\n  o: vowel\n  r: not\n  d: not -> so no consecutive vowels -> output \"word\"\n\nExample 3: \"aaeaa\" -> \n  Step1: \n      i=1: s[1]=='a' and s[0]=='a' -> both vowels -> remove s[1] -> becomes \"aeaa\"\n  Step2: \n      i=1: s[1]=='e' and s[0]=='a' -> both vowels -> remove s[1] -> becomes \"aaa\"\n  Step3: \n      i=1: s[1]=='a' and s[0]=='a' -> remove -> \"aa\"\n  Step4: \n      i=1: s[1]=='a' and s[0]=='a' -> remove -> \"a\"\n\nSo output \"a\".\n\nSo the code:\n\n  vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n\n  n = int(input().strip())\n  s = input().strip()\n\n  # We'll use a while loop until no consecutive vowels are found\n  # Start from the beginning each time we remove one.\n\n  # But note: we have to check the entire string each time? \n  # Alternatively, we can use a stack to simulate the process.\n\nAnother idea: \n  We can do a single pass with a stack.\n\n  How?\n      We traverse each character in s:\n        - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is a vowel and the current character is a vowel, then we skip the current character (because we remove the current vowel that has a vowel before it).\n        - Otherwise, we push the current character.\n\n      Why? \n        Example: \"aaeaa\"\n          Step1: 'a' -> push -> stack = ['a']\n          Step2: 'a' -> stack top is 'a' (vowel) and current is 'a' (vowel) -> skip, so stack remains ['a']\n          Step3: 'e' -> push -> stack = ['a','e'] -> but wait, 'a' and 'e' are consecutive vowels? \n          Step4: 'a' -> stack top is 'e' (vowel) and current is 'a' (vowel) -> skip? \n          Step5: 'a' -> stack top is 'a' (vowel) and current is 'a' (vowel) -> skip.\n\n        Then the stack is ['a'] -> output \"a\". \n\n      But wait: the example \"aaeaa\" becomes \"a\", so that matches.\n\n      However, let's do step by step:\n\n        s = \"aaeaa\"\n\n        i=0: 'a' -> stack = ['a']\n        i=1: 'a' -> stack top is 'a' (vowel) and current 'a' (vowel) -> skip. stack = ['a']\n        i=2: 'e' -> stack top is 'a' (vowel) and current 'e' (vowel) -> skip? \n            But wait, the problem says: we remove the second vowel in the consecutive pair. \n            In the stack, we are building the corrected string. \n\n        However, in the problem, we remove the second vowel (the one that has a vowel before it) as soon as we see two consecutive. \n\n        The stack approach: \n          We want to avoid having two consecutive vowels in the result. \n\n          The stack method: \n            We push a character if it doesn't form a consecutive vowel pair with the top of the stack.\n\n          But note: the problem says we remove the second vowel in the consecutive pair. So we don't want to push the second vowel if the top is a vowel.\n\n          So algorithm with stack:\n            for char in s:\n                if stack is not empty and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n                    # skip this char (because we remove the current one that has a vowel before it)\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    stack.append(char)\n\n          Then output ''.join(stack)\n\n        Let's test with \"aaeaa\":\n          i0: 'a' -> stack = ['a']\n          i1: 'a' -> stack[-1]='a' (vowel) and 'a' (vowel) -> skip -> stack = ['a']\n          i2: 'e' -> stack[-1]='a' (vowel) and 'e' (vowel) -> skip -> stack = ['a']\n          i3: 'a' -> stack[-1]='a' (vowel) and 'a' (vowel) -> skip -> stack = ['a']\n          i4: 'a' -> skip -> stack = ['a'] -> output \"a\"\n\n        That matches.\n\n        Test with \"weird\":\n          w -> stack = ['w']\n          e -> stack = ['w','e']\n          i -> stack[-1]='e' (vowel) and 'i' (vowel) -> skip -> so stack = ['w','e']\n          r -> stack = ['w','e','r']\n          d -> stack = ['w','e','r','d'] -> output \"werd\"\n\n        Test with \"word\":\n          w -> ['w']\n          o -> ['w','o']\n          r -> ['w','o','r']\n          d -> ['w','o','r','d'] -> \"word\"\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Why is this correct?\n          The stack method: we are building the result such that we never have two consecutive vowels. \n          When we see a vowel that would form a consecutive vowel with the top of the stack (which is a vowel), we skip the current vowel. \n\n          But note: the problem says \"deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\". \n          The stack method skips the current vowel when the top is a vowel. This effectively removes the current vowel (which is the second vowel in the consecutive pair) and we don't push it. \n\n          And we do this as we traverse from left to right. \n\n          This is equivalent to: \n            We want to avoid two consecutive vowels in the result. \n            So we push a character only if it doesn't form a consecutive vowel with the last character we kept.\n\n          This is a standard problem: remove consecutive duplicates? But here it's consecutive vowels.\n\n        So the stack solution is O(n) and efficient.\n\n        Steps:\n          n = int(input())\n          s = input().strip()\n          vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n          stack = []\n          for char in s:\n              if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n                  continue\n              else:\n                  stack.append(char)\n          print(''.join(stack))\n\n        Let me check with the example \"aaa\": \n          s = \"aaa\"\n          i0: 'a' -> stack = ['a']\n          i1: 'a' -> stack[-1] is 'a' (vowel) and 'a' (vowel) -> skip -> stack = ['a']\n          i2: 'a' -> stack[-1] is 'a' (vowel) and 'a' (vowel) -> skip -> stack = ['a'] -> output \"a\"\n\n        Correct.\n\n        So we'll go with the stack solution.\n\n        Why is it the same as the problem's step-by-step?\n          The problem: \n            \"aaeaa\" -> \n              Step1: remove the first consecutive vowel pair (the first two 'a's) -> becomes \"aeaa\"\n            Then in \"aeaa\", the next consecutive vowel pair is the 'a' and 'e'? \n          But note: the problem says: \"the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it\". \n          In \"aeaa\", the first consecutive vowel pair is at the beginning: 'a' and 'e'? \n          However, the stack solution skips the 'e' because the top of the stack is 'a' (from the first step) and then we see 'e' (vowel) -> so we skip the 'e'. \n\n          So the stack solution does the removal of the 'e' in the same step as the second character? \n\n          Actually, the problem does removals one by one and then restarts. But the stack solution does a single pass and skips the current vowel when the previous kept character is a vowel.\n\n          This is equivalent because the problem's removals are done in one pass from left to right (the first occurrence of consecutive vowels is removed immediately, and then the string is re-scanned from the beginning). \n\n          However, the stack solution does not restart the scan after each removal? But note: by skipping the current vowel, we avoid having two consecutive vowels. And the stack only keeps the last character we kept, so we don't have to re-scan the entire string.\n\n          The key: the stack solution is greedy and the problem's step-by-step removals are also greedy (removing the first consecutive pair we find). \n\n          Why is it equivalent? \n            Consider: \n              s = \"aaa\"\n              Step-by-step: \n                First: remove the second 'a' (at index1) -> \"aa\"\n                Then: remove the second 'a' (at index1) -> \"a\"\n              Stack: \n                First char: 'a' -> stack = ['a']\n                Second char: 'a' -> skip -> stack = ['a']\n                Third char: 'a' -> skip -> stack = ['a']\n\n          So the stack solution does one pass and skips the next two vowels.\n\n        Therefore, the stack solution is correct and efficient.\n\n        Let's write the code.\n\n        Steps:\n          Read n (though we don't really need it because the next line is the string, but we have to read it)\n          Read the string\n\n          Define vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n\n          Use a list as a stack.\n\n          For each char in the string:\n            if the stack is not empty and the last element in the stack is a vowel and the current char is a vowel -> skip\n            else: append the current char.\n\n          Print the stack as a string.\n\n        Note: the problem says the input has two lines: first integer n, then the string.\n\n        Example input:\n          5\n          weird\n\n        So we do:\n          n = input().strip()   # we read the integer, but we don't use n for the string processing\n          s = input().strip()\n\n        But the problem says: the next line has exactly n letters. So we can ignore n? Actually, we don't need n because we read the string.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n          n = int(input())\n          s = input().strip()\n\n        But the problem says: the second line has exactly n characters.\n\n        However, the stack solution doesn't require n. We can simply read the next line.\n\n        Code:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          s = input().strip()\n\n          vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n          stack = []\n          for char in s:\n              # Check if stack has at least one element and the top is a vowel and current is a vowel -> skip\n              if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n                  continue\n              else:\n                  stack.append(char)\n\n          print(''.join(stack))\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: s = \"weird\"\n          stack = []\n          w: not vowel -> push -> ['w']\n          e: vowel -> stack[-1]='w' (not vowel) -> push -> ['w','e']\n          i: vowel -> stack[-1]='e' (vowel) -> so skip -> stack = ['w','e']\n          r: push -> ['w','e','r']\n          d: push -> ['w','e','r','d'] -> output \"werd\"\n\n        Example 2: \"word\" -> \n          w -> ['w']\n          o -> ['w','o'] (because 'w' is not vowel)\n          r -> ['w','o','r']\n          d -> ['w','o','r','d'] -> \"word\"\n\n        Example 3: \"aaeaa\" -> \n          a -> ['a']\n          a -> stack[-1]='a' (vowel) and current 'a' (vowel) -> skip -> stack = ['a']\n          e -> stack[-1]='a' (vowel) and current 'e' (vowel) -> skip -> stack = ['a']\n          a -> skip -> stack = ['a']\n          a -> skip -> stack = ['a'] -> output \"a\"\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n        Note: the problem says the input has two lines.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          s = input().strip()\n\n        But note: the problem says the first line is the integer n. However, we don't need n for the algorithm. We can also do:\n\n          s = input().strip()   # for the first line? \n          But wait: the problem says: \n            The first line contains one integer n\n            The second line contains the string.\n\n        So we must read two lines.\n\n        Let me write the code.\n\n        Important: The problem says: \"do not directly test on the sample inputs\". We are writing a general solution.\n\n        We'll enclose in a code block.\n\n        Final code:\n\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\ns = input().strip()\n\nvowels = \"aeiouy\"\nstack = []\nfor char in s:\n    if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n        continue\n    else:\n        stack.append(char)\n\nprint(''.join(stack))\n```\n\nBut wait: the problem says that the input has exactly n letters. So we don't have to worry about extra spaces? We use .strip() to remove any extraneous whitespace.\n\nHowever, the problem says: the string consists of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.\n\nSo the input string has no spaces.\n\nBut using strip() is safe.\n\nAlternatively, we could do without strip? \n\n  The problem: \"The second line contains a string s consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters\"\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      s = input().rstrip('\\n')   # but the problem says exactly n letters, so we don't expect spaces.\n\n  However, to be safe, we strip.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"exactly n\", so if we strip, we might get a string of length less than n? \n\n  Example: if the input has a newline, then the string might have a newline? \n\n  But the problem says: the second line contains the string. \n\n  In competitive programming, it's common to use:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      s = input()\n\n  and then s has exactly n characters? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"the second line contains a string s consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters\"\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n\n  to remove any extraneous whitespace (like newline, spaces). But the problem says it's n lowercase Latin letters, so no spaces. \n\n  However, the input might have a trailing newline. So using strip() is safe.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      s = input()[:n]   # but the problem says it has exactly n, so we don't need.\n\n  But the problem says: the second line has exactly n letters. So we can just do:\n\n      s = input()\n\n  and then if the string has a newline, it will be stripped by the input() function? \n\n  Actually, `input()` reads a line and returns it without the trailing newline.\n\n  So if the input is:\n\n      5\n      weird\n\n  Then s = \"weird\" (without the newline) and has length 5.\n\n  So we don't need strip? \n\n  But the problem says: the string has exactly n letters. \n\n  However, to be safe for any trailing whitespace (if the problem has a space at the end) we use strip? \n\n  But the problem says: \"lowercase Latin letters\", so no spaces. \n\n  Let me check: the example inputs are given without spaces.\n\n  So we can do without strip? \n\n  But the problem says: \"the second line contains a string s\", so it's one line.\n\n  I think it's safe to do:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      s = input()\n\n  However, the problem says: \"exactly n\" letters. So if the input has a newline, then the string we get from input() is of length n.\n\n  So we can write:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      s = input().strip()   # to be safe\n\n  But the problem says: the string has exactly n letters, so we don't expect extra spaces. \n\n  Alternatively, we can skip the strip and just use the string as is? \n\n  Since the problem says the string has n letters, we can assume that the input string is of length n (without any extra space).\n\n  I'll go without strip to be consistent with the problem's guarantee.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"The second line contains a string s consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters\". So the string has no extra spaces.\n\n  So:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      s = input()\n\n  But note: the problem says the first line is the integer n. So we read that and then the next line is the string.\n\n  We don't use n in the algorithm.\n\n  So the code:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      s = input()\n\n      vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n      stack = []\n      for char in s:\n          if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n              continue\n          else:\n              stack.append(char)\n\n      print(''.join(stack))\n\n  Let me run the examples without strip? \n\n  Example: \n      Input: \n          5\n          weird\n\n      s = \"weird\" (without newline) -> length 5.\n\n  So it's safe.\n\n  But note: the problem says the string has exactly n letters, so we don't have to worry about extra characters.\n\n  Therefore, we write the code without strip.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Read input with `input()` exactly as problem specifies\", so we do as above.\n\n  Let me test with the provided examples in the code.\n\n  I think it's correct.\n\n  We'll output the code.\n\n  Note: the problem says: \"Enclose your code within delimiters as follows. Ensure that when the python program runs, it reads the inputs, runs the algorithm and writes output to STDOUT.\"\n\n  So we write:\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\ns = input()\n\nvowels = \"aeiouy\"\nstack = []\nfor char in s:\n    if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n        continue\n    else:\n        stack.append(char)\n\nprint(''.join(stack))\n```\n\nBut wait: the problem says: \"the first line contains one integer n\", so we read n. But we don't use it. \n\nThis is acceptable.\n\nLet me run the sample tests in my head.\n\n  TEST_1_INPUT:\n      5\n      weird\n\n  Output: \"werd\" -> correct.\n\n  So we are confident.\n\n  Now, we call strands_code_tool() to test.\n\n  However, the problem says: for the submission, we output the code block and then call strands_code_tool() in the next step? \n\n  But the instructions say: \n\n      \"Your final submission MUST contain a ```python block. No code block = failed submission.\"\n\n  And the process:\n\n      We write the code in a code block, then call strands_code_tool().\n\n  But the problem says: \n\n      \"Write code in ```python blocks in your response.\"\n\n      Then: \"The tool extracts code automatically.\"\n\n      And: \"Call strands_code_tool() after writing any solution\"\n\n  However, the instructions for the assistant: \n\n      \"After writing the code, call strands_code_tool() to test\"\n\n  But the problem says: \n\n      \"Tests pass \u2192 IMMEDIATE SUBMISSION: Next response is ONLY code block (no text, no tool call)\"\n\n  But in this case, we are to output the code block and then the next step (if we are to test) is to call strands_code_tool().\n\n  However, the problem says: \n\n      \"For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags\"\n\n  But wait: the user is asking for the solution to be written. \n\n  The problem says: \n\n      \"You will be given a question (problem specification) and will generate a correct Python program\"\n\n  So the assistant should output the code block and then call strands_code_tool() to test.\n\n  But the instructions for the assistant: \n\n      \"Your Process:\n        1. Analyze the problem\n        2. Write solution in a ```python code block with proper input/output\n        3.

        "content": "Okay, let me try to figure out why the test is failing. The error message says: \"IndentationError: unexpected indent\" at line 2.\n\nLooking at the code block in the previous attempts, I see that the user's code has 4 spaces of indentation for the first line of the code block? Wait, no. The problem says the code block should be written without extra indentation.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\n        s = input()\n\n        vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n        stack = []\n        for char in s:\n            if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n                continue\n            stack.append(char)\n\n        print(''.join(stack))\n```\n\nAh, I see the problem! The code block has extra indentation in the lines after the first line. Specifically, the second line \"s = input()\" is indented with 8 spaces (or 4 spaces * 2?), but in Python, the code should be at the same level as the first line. \n\nIn the tool's test, it's trying to run the code as is. The error is happening because the code has extra indentation. For example, in the tool's extracted code, the line \"s = input()\" is indented with 8 spaces (maybe 4 spaces of indentation from the previous line?), which is causing the \"IndentationError\".\n\nWait, no, in the code block, the user has written the code with 4 spaces of indentation for each line? Let me check.\n\nIn the code block provided by the user in their response, the lines are:\n\n```\nn = int(input())\n        s = input()\n\n        vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n        stack = []\n        for char in s:\n            if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n                continue\n            stack.append(char)\n\n        print(''.join(stack))\n```\n\nAh, the problem is that the user has added extra spaces (like 8 spaces) for some lines, which is causing the indentation error when the tool tries to run it. Because the tool expects the code to have proper indentation (no extra spaces that make the code have inconsistent indentation).\n\nIn Python, each line should have the same indentation level (usually 4 spaces per level). But in the user's code block, the lines after the first line have 8 spaces of indentation (maybe due to markdown rendering), which is causing the tool to see the code as having an extra indent.\n\nFor example, the line \"        s = input()\" has 8 spaces of indentation. But in Python, the code block should be at the top level (0 spaces). So when the tool runs it, it's trying to parse it as:\n\n    n = int(input())\n        s = input()\n\nWhich has an extra indent on the second line, causing the error.\n\nThe solution is to write the code block without any extra indentation. In markdown, when you write a code block, you shouldn't have any extra spaces at the beginning of lines.\n\nSo the corrected code block should be:\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\ns = input()\n\nvowels = \"aeiouy\"\nstack = []\nfor char in s:\n    if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n        continue\n    stack.append(char)\n\nprint(''.join(stack))\n```\n\nEach line has exactly 4 spaces of indentation for the for-loop body (or 0 for top-level lines), and no extra spaces.\n\nLet me check the indentation:\n\n- The first two lines: `n = ...` and `s = ...` are at 0 indentation.\n- The next lines: `vowels = ...`, `stack = ...` are at 0 indentation.\n- The for loop: `for char in s:` is at 0 indentation.\n- The if statement inside the for loop: `if ...:` is at 4 spaces (one level of indentation).\n- The continue and stack.append are at 4 spaces.\n\nThis is standard Python indentation.\n\nIn the previous attempts, the user's code block had extra spaces (like 8 spaces) for some lines, which caused the tool to think the code was indented incorrectly.\n\nSo the fix is to write the code block without any extra indentation.\n\nLet me write the code block correctly now.\n\nThe response should be:\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\ns = input()\n\nvowels = \"aeiouy\"\nstack = []\nfor char in s:\n    if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n        continue\n    stack.append(char)\n\nprint(''.join(stack))\n```\n\nThen call strands_code_tool().\n\nBut the problem says: \"Tests pass \u2192 IMMEDIATE SUBMISSION: Next response is ONLY code block (no text, no tool call)\"\n\nBut since we have to test first, we output the code block and then the tool call.\n\nHowever, the user's previous attempts had the code with extra indentation. So this time, we write it without extra spaces.\n\nLet me make sure: when I write this code block in markdown, it should be clean.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final answer is to output this code block, and then the tool call.\n\nBut the problem says: the tool call is to be in a tool_call XML tag.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the next response\" (if tests pass) is only the code block. So we hope this time the test passes.\n\nLet me write the response as:\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\ns = input()\n\nvowels = \"aeiouy\"\nstack = []\nfor char in s:\n    if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n        continue\n    stack.append(char)\n\nprint(''.join(stack))\n```\n\nThen, the tool call.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Do not put code in function parameters\". We are not.\n\nSo the response is:\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\ns = input()\n\nvowels = \"aeiouy\"\nstack = []\nfor char in s:\n    if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n        continue\n    stack.append(char)\n\nprint(''.join(stack))\n```\n\nAnd then the tool_call.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the tool automatically extracts the code from the most recent code block\", so we just need to output the code block and then the tool_call.\n\nSo the final response is:\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\ns = input()\n\nvowels = \"aeiouy\"\nstack = []\nfor char in s:\n    if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n        continue\n    stack.append(char)\n\nprint(''.join(stack))\n```\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"strands_code_tool\", \"arguments\": {}}\n</tool_call>"

The previous attempts showed that the code block had extra spaces (8 spaces instead of 4) in some lines, which caused an IndentationError.\n\nThe fix was to write the code block without any extra indentation. In Python, the standard is 4 spaces per indentation level. The user's code block earlier had lines with 8 spaces of indentation, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the corrected code block is:\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\ns = input()\n\nvowels = \"aeiouy\"\nstack = []\nfor char in s:\n    if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n        continue\n    stack.append(char)\n\nprint(''.join(stack))\n```\n\nEach line is properly indented: the for loop body and the if block have 4 spaces of indentation, and the top-level lines have no indentation.\n\nWhen the tool runs this code, it should work without errors. The test case passed with 0.028s, so the solution is correct.\n\nNow, since the tests passed, the next step is to output only the code block as the final submission. The problem states that if the tests pass, the next response should be ONLY the code block (no text, no tool call).\n\nSo the final answer is to output the code block as-is, without any additional text or tool calls.\n</think>\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\ns = input()\n\nvowels = \"aeiouy\"\nstack = []\nfor char in s:\n    if stack and stack[-1] in vowels and char in vowels:\n        continue\n    stack.append(char)\n\nprint(''.join(stack))\n```"
